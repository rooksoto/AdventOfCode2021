# Advent of Code 2021

## 'Tis the season...

It's that time again! As in years past, beginning December 1st, a puzzle will be posted to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com). And as in years past, I will participate, and likely will not get very far.

But no matter! We do it for the sake of the journey and what it will teach us. The destination is merely a side effect. (<--- Made this up so I don't feel super bad when I only get to the second or third puzzle.)

Let's get it!
